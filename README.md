**_# Capture-it-openly_ :camera:**
**Team Bytezz** :sparkles: presents the project :computer: **Capture it Openly** made during 48 hours of Hackathon- _**Electrothon3.0**_ conducted by **SPEC, NIT Hamirpur** under the **Human Removal Foreground Challenge(Organisational Problem Statement from Spyne.ai)**

**_What we Did?_**
>We have developed an effective solution to facilitate picture :camera: capturing so that people can freely capture and edit according to their own wishes by removing the unwanted part without reducing the quality image.
This has been achieved using **Semantic Segmentation,Floodfill Function and GANS Model**

**Our Approach:**
>_We trained a semantic segmentation model that automatically creates the mask over the subjects of the image that improves user-experience_

>_Applied floodfill function on our modelâ€™s output that helps the user to keep the main subject of the image._

>_Currently,we are working on data set of CGANS Model_
